            In loveEarth you would be able to collect points as you are also collecting trash at the beach. 
              this game is going to be the life of the party and you are going to be able to have a lot 
              of fun and you won't even realize the time that has gone by as you play the game. 
              In the game players will be able to learn about the issues of climate change and will also be 
              able to partake and seeing cute animals and As you continue the levels will get a little more harder as
              the trash will get further and maybe even not even seen.

            </p>
            <p class=""> 
             My game sets apart from a lot of other games because obviously it's something that 
              I created and I had a vision for it to be something very different from many other people's but 
              I think that obviously this game is Just envisioning an issue in the world that is very much unseen
              and I hope that with this game people are able to see it more and I don't think it's just some game 
              I think it's also setting an example for future generations and telling them issues that they should be 
              aware of.

            <p class="w3-margin-top-2"> 
             In LoveEarth, I really wanted to focus on one theme: climate change .
              My intention was to find a way to help us better understand what causes climate change . 
              When I developed the idea for my game, I envisioned a fun approach that would engage people with a pressing 
              global issue . Through my game design , I aimed to encourage creativity while highlighting a specific cause of
              climate change : littering. A significant factor in this issue is fashion , 
              as we often follow trends that eventually lead us to discard clothing that we no longer use. 
              Many of us imagine these clothes being preserved in some way , but in reality, they often end up in the ocean,
              harming marine life and ecosystems .As I considered the color scheme and theme for designing the game ,
              I wanted to keep it simple yet creative and colorful .

            </p>
            <p class=""> 
              I believe that vibrant colors attract people more effectively, so I made the game visually appealing. 
              I incorporated various sea animals and opted for a beach theme, as this aligns with my primary focus .
              In designing my game, I aimed for a balance between challenging and straightforward gameplay. 
              For levels one and two , I ensured that players could easily identify the trash and litter in the images. 
              They can click on the photos to gain points . However, if they fail to click on the trash , 
              they won 't receive any points, emphasizing the game 's purpose: to clean up the beach . 
              If players neglect this task, it can lead to further harm to marine life and increase the likelihood of 
              climate change .

            <p class="w3-margin-top-2"> 
            The main reason I created my game was because I wanted it to be interesting, fun, and visually appealing.
              I saw a lot of potential in the idea and wanted to make sure it was something people would enjoy looking at 
              and playing. From the start, I focused on the design and visuals,  because I believe if a game isn’t 
              aesthetically pleasing, people might not be drawn to it. I put a lot of effort into making it look 
              nice so that it would grab people’s attention and encourage them to play and learn. 
            </p>
            <p class=""> 
             The main focus of my game is climate change, specifically how trash affects the environment. 
              Trash in the ocean doesn’t just harm sea animals it also damages the planet and, 
              in turn, affects us as humans. I wanted the game to be child-friendly, not childish because 
              I think it’s important for younger generations to understand the impact of pollution and how they can help.
              I also included resources in the game so players can learn more about reducing plastic use and making 
              better environmental choices.
