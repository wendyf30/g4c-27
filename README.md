# 🎮 G4C Game Hosting Page Assignment

Build your own game portfolio site and go live like a real dev!

---

## 🧾 Overview:
You’ve designed an awesome game—now it’s time to share it with the world using a custom web page! You'll customize a pre-made template and publish it online using **GitHub Pages**. This is your opportunity to showcase your **creativity, design thinking, and technical skills**.

---

## ✅ What to Do:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Project Repository
- Go to this GitHub repo:  
  👉 [https://github.com/Thomas-A-Edison-CTE-HS/G4C.git](https://github.com/Thomas-A-Edison-CTE-HS/G4C.git)
- Fork or Clone it into **your own GitHub account**.
- Open the project in your **code editor**.

---

### 2️⃣ Customize Your Web Page
Open `index.html` and make it yours:

#### ✍️ Replace all *Lorem ipsum* text with your original writing:

- 🎯 **PITCH** – What is your game about? What’s the objective? Why will players love it?
- 🌱 **THEME** – Choose one of the official G4C themes and explain how your game ties into it:
  - Outplay Hunger  
  - Nurture Yourself with Nature  
  - Peace Formers  
- 🧠 **MY WHY** – Why did you create this game? What message or impact do you hope it has?

#### ✨ Also update:
- The **quote/tagline** at the top
- Your **name and role**
- Your **avatar image** or placeholder
- The **LinkedIn** or social media link (can be fake/blank if preferred)

---

### 3️⃣ Show Off Your Game

Depending on where your game is hosted:

✅ **If it's embeddable**, like from *Itch.io*, update the `<iframe>` link.

⚠️ **If it’s on Play.Unity.com**, it won’t embed:
- Record a **short demo video** of your game (screen capture)
- Add it to your page using the included `<video>` element
- Include a **direct link** to your Unity-hosted game so others can play it!
